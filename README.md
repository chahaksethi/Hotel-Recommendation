# Hotel-Recommendation

In this project we predicted implict ratings for hotels using Booking.com data in PyTorch. Following are the steps followed:

1) For predicting ratings we developed a matrix factorization algorithm. 
2) To solve for the cold start problem and predict ratings for 80% of new users in the test sample, we sued the Neural Networks.
3) Finally, ensembling both the above models gave the best results on the test data.

Please refer to the powerpoint presentation for more details.
